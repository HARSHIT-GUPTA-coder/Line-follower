# Line-follower-on-Gazebo

This repo contains my code for simulating a Line Follower on Gazebo.
The path for the line follower is added as a texture to the floor. For the camera on bot to detect the texture move the floor model to the default model directory of Gazebo.
For the line follower to follow a random path, change the texture of floor to the path you want the bot to follow. Ensure that the strating point is at (0,0).
(The bot may need some fine tuning. Change the thresholds and speed ratios in the plugin to fine tune the model.)
The video is the testing of the bot on a random path.
